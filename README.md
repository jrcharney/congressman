Ideas for running for state congress

Hi! I'm Jason Charney!  And I'm _thinking_ about running for the Missouri House of Representatives 68th District (Florissant, Missouri!)

This github is a project for anyone thinking about running for government but don't really know how.

Running for political office does cost money.  Especially if you want to make Pins, Bumper Stickers, Signs, T-shirts, media interviews, etc.  Heck, at some point, you'll need to go down to the local Department Store or taylor to look nice, and of course hold social events, and election parties, and rent out space for electioneering and campaiging, and TV ads, and to pay advisor, and to buy sodas and snacks for volunteers, and--wow there's a lot more work than I though.

But let's take money out of the equation.  What if we could do this without money?  Sure, we'll still need it and people to help get the campagin going, but what if we could?

Well, we could look at this this way.

* Why would I be more qualified that someone else?
* What issues would I care about?
* What would I do in my first 90 days if elected? (Keep in mind, this is for State Rep, not Governor.)

There"s plenty to think about.

What I would like to see is a Data Driven Democracy.  The kind that automatically tracks spending and resources and can make estimates at a fraction of the cost that it would to have a proprietary company charge to keep the state pumping money in their direction and toward things that are out of state.  (Did you know that in the State of Missouri, we use a service in Atlanta, Georgia to write out checks for the state?  How did that happen?)

At any rate, most of my issues will be technology related.  I grow weary of our state's continued spiritual issues over abortion and funding to run Planned Parenthood out of state and trying to make Missouri more like Kansas.

This 68th District of Missouri has had a history of electing Democrats, but our relected representative Keith English has jumped ship from the Democratic party to become what he calls an "independent".  If you Google what he's done in the past year to poke the ire of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local #1 and being the tiebreaking vote for a couple of important issues that liberal democrats had hoped he would have pushed for, despite our state having a hyper-majority or Republicans in both houses, you'd be disappointed with him too.

Yet, when we relected him last year, we had picked him because he was the democratic choice in Blue North St. Louis County in a state full of Red hard-right religious Republicans raised on Jerry Fallwell, Pat Robertson, and Benny Hinn.

So now North County has lost its voice.  Fortunately, I'm the kind of guy who talks really loudly.
